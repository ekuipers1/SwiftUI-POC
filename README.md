# SwiftUI-POC
ðŸš€ What's Inside the App? The app is more than just a repository of code; it's a testament to the versatility and power of SwiftUI. It features:

Language Recognition: Delve into the world of natural language processing.

Vertical Scroller: A smooth and responsive UI component.

MapView with Annotation: Integrating geolocation features seamlessly.

API Call View: Demonstrating network communication within SwiftUI.

ðŸ”¥ Latest Addition: Typography Section The most recent update, which is still a work in progress, introduces a 'Typography' section. This segment is designed to be a visual guide to the myriad of Typography options available in SwiftUI. It's an endeavor to make font styling and text manipulation more intuitive and accessible for developers.

ðŸ”— Stay Tuned and Contribute I am committed to regularly updating the app with new features and improvements. Feel free to explore and use to this evolving project.

ðŸŒŸ Looking Ahead As we move forward, I'm excited about adding more features and refining the existing ones. Stay connected for more updates and enhancements that will enrich our understanding and use of SwiftUI.
